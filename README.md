## Why twitch?

I was looking for a complex project to do, and procrastinating on some websites I thought how cool it was to clone [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), so I did it, not completely, but it's done, after a couple of days.
<br/><br/>
## What was the biggest challenge?

Certainly, to have fidelity to the original site, it took most of the time to mimic the original one, however, it is not perfectly cloned, but I am very happy with the result, I managed to make some mechanics the same, and even added some animations.
<br/><br/>
## What have you improved in your skills?

To clone a site it was necessary to use the chrome development tools, and with it, I was able to learn how large sites are built, and even without making a mobile version, I was able to learn that you shouldn't use % or VH/VW, something I was used to doing in the past and has caused my projects to have hundreds of media queries.
