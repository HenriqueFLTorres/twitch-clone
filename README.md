## Why twitch? 🎞️

I was looking for a complex project to do, and procrastinating on some websites I thought how cool it was to clone [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), so I did it, not completely, but it's done, after a couple of days.
<br/><br/>
## What was the biggest challenge? ⛰️

Certainly, to have fidelity to the original site, it took most of the time to mimic the original one, however, it is not perfectly cloned, but I am very happy with the result, I managed to make some mechanics the same, and even added some animations.
<br/><br/>
## What have you improved in your skills? 🖋️

To clone a site it was necessary to use the chrome development tools, and with it, I was able to learn how large sites are built, and even without making a mobile version, I was able to learn that you shouldn't use % or VH/VW, something I was used to doing in the past and has caused my projects to have hundreds of media queries.
